Local Variables:
These variables are created inside a block of code
are called local variables, for example, all the variables that we
create inside loops, if else statements, methods, switch statements.
Pros:
They occupy the memory for the shortest period of time.
Cons:
They can only be accessed inside the block of code where they are created.
When to use Local Variables:
Always try to use local variables


Instance Variables:
These variables are created outside of blocks of code but inside a class.
Pros:
These variables can be used anywhere inside the class.
Cons:
They keep on occupying the memory even if you are done using them.
When to use Instance Variables:
1)When you want to share a variable with all of the instance methods of a class
2)When you are planning to create multiple objects of a class and you know that
every object is going to have a different value, then you can also use instance variables.


Static Variable:
These variables have the static keyword before them.
Pros:
Highest visibility can be accessed inside the class in any block of code,
can be accessed in static or non-static methods.
Can be accessed outside of class if coupled with a proper access modifier.
Cons:
Then stay in the memory for the longest.
When should we use Static Variables:
When we want to share something with all the objects or the information
that says the same for all the objects.
